devwsys \- hosted window system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B devwsys

] [
.B -a

}

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I devwsys
program serves a connection to a 9P file system providing an interface to a non-Plan 9
window system.

After a mount of
.I address
(which defaults to
.I /tmp/ns.$USER.$DISPLAY/wsys
if the flag
.B -a
is not used) a new window is created and access is given to a file system similar to the union of
.IR rio(4)
and
.IR draw(3).
If the
.B -d
option is given 9P debug information will be sent to stderr.

Devwsys windows can be managed by the corresponding window manager in the host system or using the
9P file system. The files in the
.I draw
directory are equivalent to the files served by
.IR draw(3)
, with the particularity that reading the
.I draw/new
file will associate the new client to the corresponding window, whose file system is then presented in
.I draw/n/window.
The files in the root and
.I wsys/n
directories act like their
.IR rio(4)
counterparts. However, devwsys does not provide any text editing capabilities and writting to the
.I cons
file is not allowed. Writes to the file
.I consctl
are ignored.

If
.I spec
is equal to
.I /
a new window will not be created, and the mounted file system will only contain the directories
.I draw
and
.I wsysÂ¸
as well as
.I snarf
and
.I kill
files. When open for reading, the
.I kill
file returns the pid given in the attach spec of a window when that window is
requested for deletion, instead of deleting it. A second attemp will always delete the window.

The
.I wctl
rc script, when launched from Plan 9, posts a wctl service analogous to that one of
.IR rio(1)
, which uses
.I wsys
as its window system. It can be used in conjuction with 
.IR devwsys(4)
to facilitate the usage of the window command (see
.IR rio(1)
) and correctly finalize processes when windows are deleted (using the
.I kill
file). The flag
.B -c
can be used to set a default command, instead of
.B rio -i window.

.SH FILES
.TF /mnt/wsys
.TP
.B /mnt/wsys
mount point for
.IR devwsys (4)

.SH BUGS
When reading from the kill file, if the user requests to close a window or the program running in a window finishes, the window may stay on screen. Successive attempts of closing the window will succeed.

There should be OS X and Windows versions of devwsys.
