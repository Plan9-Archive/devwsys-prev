wctl
----

The wctl rc script can be run from a Plan 9 system to serve a wctl
service using an existing wsys service, see wsys(4).

Eg:
	wsys='#Z/tmp/ns.username.:0/wsys'
	wctl=`wctl $wsys'
	window games/catclock


devdraw.9p
----------

9p-srv.c is a p9p's devdraw(1) version which uses wsys(4) through
9pclient(2). To install it:
	cp 9p-srv.c $PLAN9/src/cmd/devdraw
	cd $PLAN9/src/cmd/devdraw
	9c 9p-srv.c && 9l -o devdraw.9p 9p-srv.o
	cp devdraw.9p $PLAN9/bin
	DEVDRAW=$PLAN9/bin/devdraw.9p export DEVDRAW

Eg:
	# From rio:
	; mount $wsys /n/w new
	; bind -a /dev /n/w
	; aux/listen1 -tv 'tcp!*!12345' /bin/exportfs -r /n/w

	# From unix:
	$ WSYS='tcp!127.0.0.1!12345'
	$ DEVDRAW=$PLAN9/bin/devdraw.9p
	$ 9term

	# Alternatively, if using wsys instead of rio:
	$ WSYS='unix!/tmp/ns.username.:0/wsys'

The patch p9p.patch needs to be applied to the p9p tree in order to use
devdraw.9p. It will not affect the usage of other drawing devices.
